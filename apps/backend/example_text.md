Project Meeting Notes - Q4 Planning Session

Yesterday's quarterly planning meeting covered several key areas for the upcoming quarter. The product team presented their roadmap with three major features planned: the new dashboard redesign, mobile app improvements, and integration with third-party analytics tools.

Budget discussions revealed we're slightly over on development costs but under on marketing spend. Sarah suggested reallocating $50k from marketing to hire an additional developer to help with the mobile app timeline.

The marketing team shared user feedback from the recent survey - most users want better mobile performance and more customization options. This aligns well with our planned mobile improvements.

For the dashboard redesign, we decided to go with Option B from the design team's proposals. It's cleaner and more intuitive based on user testing results. Timeline is 8 weeks with beta testing starting in week 6.

Action items: John will draft the job posting for the new developer position, Lisa will create detailed specs for the mobile improvements, and I'll schedule follow-up meetings with the design team to finalize dashboard mockups. Next planning meeting is scheduled for January 15th.

The team agreed to implement bi-weekly sprint reviews to keep projects on track and ensure we hit our Q1 launch targets.
